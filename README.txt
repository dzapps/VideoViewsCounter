Video Views Counter
==================

- What's this?

Ever wondered how many total video views an artist like PSY or the videos titled "harlem shake" or "gangnam style" have? Well, now you can! This simple web app does that calculation for you for you and provides a list of the top 30 videos with links to YouTube videos. 

View it in action here:  http://www.yashksagar.com/ViewsCounter/videoviewcounter.html

- How to run?

Place the 'videoviewcounter.html' and the 'js' and 'css' directories in the same path and run the .html in the web browser (preferably one that supports HTML5 :) )

- [ Note: The search results are limited to the top 40 videos to make things simpler and faster.]
