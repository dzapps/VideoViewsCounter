Video Views Counter
==================

- What is this?

Ever wondered how many views do the videos titled "harlem shake" or "gangnam style" have? Well, now you can! This simple web app does that calculation for you for any keyword that you want to search for. 

- How to run?

Place the 'videoviewcounter.html' and the 'js' and 'css' directories in the same path and run the .html in the web browser (preferably one that supports HTML5 :) )

- [ Note: The search results are limited to the top 30 videos to make things simpler and faster.]
